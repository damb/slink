# [SeedLink](https://seedlink.readthedocs.io/) server and client library

> **IMPORTANT NOTE**: this is a hobby project. The library doesn't provide full
> functionality, yet, and is heavily under WIP. Therefore, the API may
> dramatically change over time.

In future, the library will implement:

- A client implementing both the SeedLink `v3` and `v4` protocol.
- A server framework implementing the SeedLink `v4` protocol layer in order to
  dramatically simplify the implementation of a SeedLink `v4` server.
